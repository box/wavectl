\[!\[Project Status\]\(http://opensource.box.com/badges/active.svg\)\]\(http://opensource.box.com/badges\)

A command line client for \[Wavefront\]\(https://www.wavefront.com\) inspired by
\[kubectl\]\(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/\) and
\[git\]\(https://git-scm.com/docs\) command line tools.


\#\# Example Commands

A short list of common usages. For more details \[Use Cases\]\(#example-use-cases\) section.


\#\#\# Show one line summaries for Wavefront alerts


```eval_rst
 .. program-output:: wavectl show alert
    :prompt:
    :returncode: 0
    :ellipsis: 4
```

\#\#\# Show json state of alerts


```eval_rst
 .. program-output:: wavectl show -o json alert
    :prompt:
    :returncode: 0
    :ellipsis: 19
```



\#\#\# Modify a dashboard's json and write it back to Wavefront



```
   $> vim ./metadata-dashboard.json    # Modify the json state of a dashboard
   $> wavectl push ./metadata-dashboard.json  dashboard  # Write the new version to Wavefront
```

```eval_rst
 .. program-output:: mutateDashboards.py
    :returncode: 0
```


\#\# Example Use Cases

\- \[Command line operations on your alerts, dashboards\]\(doc/CommandLine.md\)

\- \[Advanced grep in your alerts and dashboards\]\(doc/AdvancedGrep.md\)

\- \[Launch Wavefront GUI via \`wavectl\`\]\(doc/BrowserIntegration.md\)

\- \[Repetitive editing of alerts, dashboards\]\(doc/RepetitiveEditing.md\)

\- \[Simple templating of alerts, dashboards with \`wavectl\`\]\(doc/Templating.md\)

\- \[Easy configuration of \`wavectl\`\]\(doc/WavectlConfig.md\)



\#\# \[Command Reference\]\(doc/CommandReference.md\)


\#\# Installation

To install the latest release:

```
    pip install wavectl
```

To install from the master branch in github:

```
    pip install git+https://github.com/box/wavectl.git
```

The master branch may contain unreleased features or bug fixes. The master branch
\*should\* always stay stable.

\#\# A note about Performance

\`wavectl\`'s execution time depends on the number of alerts or dashboards you
have in Wavefront. All
\[resource filtering\]\(doc/CommandReference.md#resource-options\) except the
\`--customerTag, -t\` option is done on the client side. This enables the
powerful regular expression matching on your results. But if your organization
has thousands of alerts and dashboards, the data size may overwhelm the
\`wavectl\` execution time.

If your organization has a lot of alerts and dashboards in Wavefront we
strongly recommend to use \`--customerTag\` option in your commands. The
filtering based on customerTag is done on the Wavefront server side. With
\`--customerTags\` option, wavectl client will only receive data about
alerts/dashboards if they are tagged with all of the specified tags. This
reduces the data size processed by wavectl and results in faster execution.

\#\# Notes

If you could not find what you were looking for please consider
\[contributing\]\(CONTRIBUTING.md\). You could also take a look at
\[another\]\(https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/ruby-client/blob/master/README-cli.md\)
CLI implementation for Wavefront. That one is written by Wavefront and mirrors their
web api more closely. This \`wavectl\` CLI has evolved from our use cases.

\`wavectl\` is designed to add automation, command line access to Wavefront
data that is \*\*human generated\*\*. Initial examples are alerts and
dashboards. We see those as more permanent, slow changing state in Wavefront.
\`wavectl\` is not optimized to read, write time series data to Wavefront or
any other data that is ingested by Wavefront at real time production workload
scale.
